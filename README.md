## Overview

This mini crm project is built using several key software development concepts, including:

- Interfaces
- Database listeners and events
- Jobs

These concepts are used to create a flexible and scalable software application, Let's take a closer look at what these concepts mean.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are contracts that define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. In this project, interfaces are used to define methods that are used across multiple classes, allowing for greater code reuse and modularity.

## Database Listeners and Events

Database listeners and events are used to monitor changes to the database and execute code in response to those changes. This can be useful for performing automated tasks or updating related data in real time.

## Jobs

Jobs are asynchronous tasks that can be scheduled and run in the background of a software application. This can be useful for offloading resource-intensive tasks from the main application thread, improving performance and scalability.
